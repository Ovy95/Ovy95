### Hi there :bowtie:

Crafting Stone to Crafting Code, from Stonemason to Developer. I Attended Makers Academy and I'm now developing my skills to land myself a full-time job in tech.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a developer for Acknowledge, along with developing my skills for learning the tech stack used at UNI Roomy. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on growing a better TDD process using Jasmine and Javascript solving little projects, attending reviews through Makers and solving katas. I have recently created a Github repo to showcase some of the katas I have completed to help me with my process. I try to do these daily, check it out in my pinned repos.
